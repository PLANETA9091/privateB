/**
 * Drowning policy (pure, no bot dependencies - unit-testable).
 *
 * Fleet 900 s run (v0.11.3 era) measured two mid-run drownings (F1, F3, server
 * log "drowned") with the same shape every time: a bot walks into water (the
 * pathfinder charges liquidCost=1 per water block - crossing a lake is FREE),
 * sinks - vanilla physics has no swim-up without a held jump key - and the air
 * bar runs out while the work loop keeps issuing pathfinder goals that fight
 * every manual control state. A paused bot was a dead bot in combat; a sinking
 * bot is a dead bot here.
 *
 * Two layers, matching the combat stack's design:
 *   - prevention: the pathfinder movements get a real liquidCost (wiring), so
 *     paths PREFER land detours and casual lake crossings stop being free;
 *   - rescue: a fast sentry detects head-submersion / air loss and runs a raw
 *     controls swim (the tunnel + shelter lesson: pathfinder fails under
 *     adverse conditions - mob shoving there, buoyancy here).
 *
 * Everything decision-shaped lives here; miner.mjs owns the reads and the
 * controls.
